# Algorithm Challenge #35 – Print Each Word in a String (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a full line of text from the user and prints each word on a separate line.

The string is processed using a delimiter-based approach, where a space character is used to identify word boundaries.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- String manipulation using `find()`, `substr()`, and `erase()`
- Parsing text using delimiters
- Handling full-line user input with `getline()`
- Writing clean and modular C++ functions
- Developing step-by-step algorithmic thinking
- Understanding how data flows through iterative processing

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**

Enter a string:  
Hello world from C++

**Output:**
Hello  
world  
from  
C++

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** print_each_word.cpp
- **Challenge Level:** Level 3
- **Challenge Number:** #35

💬 Notes
-
This challenge focuses on *engineering-style problem solving* rather than syntax alone.  
The goal is to think about how text data is segmented, processed, and transformed step by step.

Delimiter-based algorithms are widely used in:
- Compilers
- Text processors
- Data parsers
- Network protocols
